# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

3. Start the game:
   ```bash
   make start
   ```
   Note: If you don't have `make` installed, you'll need to compile the code manually and then run the executable file.

## Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') in an empty cell.
- The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
- The game ends in a draw if the entire board is filled, and no player has won.
